#### Vehicle Number Detection Sample Project

- This project is to extract the vehicle numbers from the uploaded image.
- Used the Python image recoginition and extraction libraries for extracting the number from the vehicle number plate.
- This is a base project and need to fine tune for the more accurate results.
- We can upload a image after running the project. The basic UI is similar to the below

- There is a slight deviation in the recognition but we need to fine tune the detection. The accuracy here is 60% to 70%
